This repository contains some simple [RShiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) applications that I developed to illustrate topics I cover in my undergraduate course on [Evolutionary Biology](https://cdmuir.netlify.com/#teaching). The applications are hosted at shinyapps.io. Below you'll find a list of direct links to make access a bit
more convenient.

* [Allele frequency changes with genetic drift](https://cdmuir.shinyapps.io/Genetic-Drift-Fixation/)
* [Selection at one locus with two alleles](https://cdmuir.shinyapps.io/Viability-selection1/)
* [Gene trees and coalescence](https://cdmuir.shinyapps.io/coalescence/)

These apps are adapted from other apps by [Kent Holsinger](https://kholsinger.github.io/PopGen-Shiny/) and [Silas Tittes](https://github.com/silastittes/shiny_popgen).
